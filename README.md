# Task 1: Netflix Dataset Cleaning

### Summary of Cleaning
I used Excel to clean the raw Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.  

- Removed duplicate records using title, type, and release_year.  
- Filled missing values (e.g., director, country) with "Unknown".  
- Standardized column headers (lowercase, underscores instead of spaces).  
- Reformatted `date_added` column to DD-MM-YYYY.  
- Ensured categorical values are consistent (Movie/TV Show).  
- Checked and fixed data types (release_year as integer, date_added as date).  

### Final Result
The final dataset is consistent, clean, and ready for further analysis.
